Curse of the Black Sunspot is a short mission OXP set in Galaxy 3. 

It will start when the player is in Galaxy 3 with an Elite rating of
at least Dangerous. The mission involves a couple of tricky fights,
but can be completed with a standard Cobra III.

This is an "informal" mission - no-one is hiring you: there is simply
a situation which you can choose to interact with or avoid. Therefore,
it might take you a while before you find out where to go and what to
do to find the situation. Alternatively, you might accidentally
stumble into it while going about your normal business.

No other OXPs are required, though Random Ship Names is strongly
recommended, and users of Snoopers and New Cargoes will find a few
additional hints about the situation delivered through the messages in
those OXPs.

Many thanks to Solonar and Diziet Sma for testing and feedback.
